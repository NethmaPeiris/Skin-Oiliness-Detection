# Skin-Oiliness-Detection
This repository contains code for an image classification project focusing on categorizing facial images based on skin type. The project includes data augmentation, K-Means clustering, and a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for training and evaluation

# Key Features:

Image data augmentation for enhancing training dataset.
K-Means clustering to group augmented images into categories.
Pretrained CNN model for image classification.
Model testing script for evaluating the model on new images.

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Follow the provided scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, augmentation, clustering, and model training.
Test the trained model on new images using the provided examples.
